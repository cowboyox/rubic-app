    {
      "QUESTION": "What is Rubic?",
      "ANSWER": "Rubic is a multichain DeFi ecosystem, which features cross-chain, P2P, and instant swaps across multiple blockchains, aiming to deliver a complete ONE-STOP decentralized platform."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "Who can use our service?",
      "ANSWER": "Anyone who wants to create and manage their tokens, or either owns a cryptocurrency and wishes to exchange it. KYC is not required."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "What are the minimum and maximum trade size?",
      "ANSWER": "There are no limits."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How does it work?",
      "ANSWER": "There are two options for trading:\n First, you create a trade on your own terms and wait till another part agrees with them and fills his share.\n Second, you choose the instant trade option and you will automatically get the market rates.\n\nYou can create your own token without any coding skills and trade it without having to be listed."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "Which cryptocurrencies are supported?",
      "ANSWER": "At the moment, Rubic allows trading for Ethereum-based tokens (ERC-20) and Binance Smart Chain tokens (BEP-20). More blockchains will be implemented soon (see Roadmap). However, to create and manage tokens we already provide multichain services supported by Ethereum, Tron, EOS, NEO and Binance Smart Chain."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "Should I list my token before using your service?",
      "ANSWER": "No, you can trade any tokens, by manually add their contract addresses. However, you can contact us and we will add your token to our list."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How to start?",
      "ANSWER": "It is easy and fast. You only need the MetaMask crypto wallet (more wallets will be supported). Choose the blockchain in which you want to swap tokens, and choose to trade either with Instant Trades or Order Book."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How to create a trade?",
      "ANSWER": "<span class='faq__highlight'>Order Book:</span>\n<strong>Step 1:</strong> Select your blockchain in which you want to swap tokens and choose Order Book. \n<strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose the tokens you want to exchange, at your desired rate.\n<strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose advanced options, such as closing date and time, minimum and maximum contribution, privacy, brokerage fee, lock liquidity until the trade completion. \n<strong>Step 4:</strong> Check details of the trade. \n<strong>Step 5:</strong> Click Create Trade.\n<strong>Step 6:</strong> Use MetaMask to confirm your trade. \n<strong>Step 7:</strong> Contribute to your part of the deal.\n<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FCHTOT9Z9k' target='_blank'>Video tutorial (this method works for any blockchain)</a>\n\n<span class='faq__highlight'>Instant Trades:</span>\n<strong>Step 1:</strong> Select Instant Trades and fill out the form, by choosing the tokens you want to exchange.\n<strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter the desired amount you want to exchange.\n<strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, the DEX aggregator, will automatically show you the best rates across multiple protocols.\n<strong>Step 4:</strong> Press Create trade button.\n<strong>Step 5:</strong> Use MetaMask to confirm your trade, and now wait for the transaction to be confirmed into the blockchain.\n<a href='https://youtu.be/kxg9GQvBU2A' target='_blank'>Video tutorial</a>\n"
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How much does it cost?",
      "ANSWER": "Currently, our service doesn't charge any fee for Instant Trades. But we have a fee of 0.015 ETH for the creating Order Book trade."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How long does it take to complete a deal?",
      "ANSWER": "For the Order Book trades, the deal will be completed as soon as the other side completes its side.\nFor the Instant Trades, the deal will be completed as soon as it gets confirmed on the blockchain."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How the privacy and security of the transaction are ensured?",
      "ANSWER": "The deal is secured by smart contracts verified by experienced developers and external audit."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How many people can participate in one deal (Order Book)?",
      "ANSWER": "Up to 10 people can participate on each side."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "What will happen if the second part doesn’t complete a deal (P2P)?",
      "ANSWER": "After its expiration date, you will need to go to your trades table and click on 'Withdraw', this way you will get your tokens back (network fee will apply)."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "If I created a deal, however, I have changed my mind, can I cancel it?",
      "ANSWER": "For Order Book trades: Yes, you can cancel your deal any time before the part starts completing their side. If you cancel a deal, you'll get your tokens back.\nFor Instant Trades: Most of the time, the answer is NO. This action is actually an attempt to overwrite a currently pending transaction with a new one. Please check <a href='https://info.etherscan.com/how-to-cancel-ethereum-pending-transactions/' target='_blank'>official external services info</a>"
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How to add Binance Smart Chain and Matic networks to MetaMask?",
      "ANSWER": "<a href='/assets/book.pdf' target='_blank'>Please click here for more details.</a>"
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How to use cross-chain bridge?",
      "ANSWER": "<strong>Step 1.</strong> Install MetaMask wallet (<a href='www.metamask.io' target='_blank'>www.metamask.io</a>) and connect it to Rubic.exchange. \n\n<strong>Step 2.</strong> Choose your exchange destination (from Ethereum to Binance or vice-versa). You can switch your destination by clicking on the swap arrows button. \n\n<strong>Step 3.</strong> Currently, users are able to swap 25 ERC20 tokens with their corresponding BEP20 version, and vice-versa (and the list keeps getting updated). The list of tokens:\nUSDT to BUSDT-T (Tether)\nETH to ETH (Ethereum)\nBBTC to BTCB (Bitcoin)\nBBCH to BCH (Bitcoin Cash)\nBDOT to DOT (Polkadot)\nBFIL to FIL (Filecoin)\nSNX to SNX (Synthetix Network Token)\nDAI to DAI (Dai Stablecoin)\nBAND to BAND (BandToken)\nBAT to BATBasic (Attention Token)\nLINK to LINK (ChainLink)\nUNI to UNI (Uniswap)\nYFII to YFII (DFI.Money)\nYFI to YFI (yearn.finance)\nBUSD to BUSD (Binance USD)\nCOMP to COMP (Compound)\nMKR to MKR (Maker)\nTCT to TCTToken (Club Token)\nIOTX to IOTX (IoTeX)\nBEL to BEL (Bella Protocol)\nELF to ELF (aelf)\nPAX to PAX (Paxos Standard)\nUSDC to USDC (USD Coin)\nINJ to INJ (Injective Protocol)\nSXP to SX (Swipe)\n\n<strong>Step 4.</strong> Enter the number of tokens you want to swap (check below the minimum and maximum amount of tokens that you’re able to exchange). Proceed next if you are satisfied with the returning amount of tokens (this includes the Binance fee).\n\n<strong>Step 5.</strong> You can view tokens' contracts by clicking on 'Check on Etherscan/BSCscan'.\n\n<strong>Step 6.</strong>  Click Create Swap, followed by MetaMask's trade confirmation. \n\n<strong>Step 7.</strong> Please wait until the transaction will be recorded in the blockchain. Once your transaction is accepted you will be notified. You can find the transaction details in the table. Please wait until the Binance will process it as well."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "I'm not able to use cross-chain swaps, it appears I have exceeded the limit. What should I do?",
      "ANSWER": "Please wait and try again later, as currently there is a limit of 3 cross-chain swaps in 30 minutes. This will soon improve."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How long does it take to complete a cross-chain swap?",
      "ANSWER": "It usually varies, and this does not depend on us, but on the two blockchains.\nAs estimations we have 2 minutes for initialization, then 4 minutes for feedback waiting, and another couple of  minutes for deposit. \n\nThe current average time is approximately 10 minutes."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "What are the benefits of Uniswap integration?",
      "ANSWER": "Users will be able to choose the suitable DEX protocol in order to get the best tokens rates with the lowest gas prices."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "Why do we need to make a choice between 1inch and Uniswap?",
      "ANSWER": "The gas fees and price rates of these protocols are different, therefore the opportunity of having more options empowers the users to better trading decisions."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "Is the token approval included in the gas fee?",
      "ANSWER": "Token approval is not included in the gas fee. Please note that it is required to approve a token just once, while the first use. Here is how it can look like:\n <img src='/assets/images/faq/approve-token.png' class='faq__img' />"
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "What should I do when I see the message:\n<div class='faq__warning'><span class='faq__warning-flex-container'>Trading on Uniswap is not available</span></div>?",
      "ANSWER": "If you get this message please try the next methods:\n1. Reload the page\n2. Clear website cache\n3. Log out and then log in into MetaMask\nIf it still not working please contact our support team."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "What should I do if Uniswap doesn’t display the rates?",
      "ANSWER": "In order to see the Uniswap rates you will need to login with your MetaMask account, once logged in refresh the page as well."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "What is the purpose of Limit Orders?",
      "ANSWER": "Limit orders allow users to buy or sell a token at a desired rate and offer them the opportunity for the order book trades to be automatically completed after certain conditions are met."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "What are the conditions for completing a Limit Order?",
      "ANSWER": "The conditions for a limit order to be automatically filled are:\n<ul><li>The trade rate from the order book is the same as the market rate, including gas fee + platform reward (that is now 0.15 ETH, this will change over time).</li><li>Trade is not expired.</li></ul>Also the order can be completed if other users accept the trade parameters and participate in the trade."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How to use Limit Orders?",
      "ANSWER": "<strong>Step 1:</strong> Select your blockchain in which you want to swap tokens and choose Order Book (currently, the Limit Orders feature supports trades on Ethereum, so you would want to select the Ethereum network - more blockchains will be supported in the future).\n\n<strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose the tokens you want to exchange, at your desired rate. Currently, only “RBC-ETH” and “ETH-RBC” pairs are available.\n\n<strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose advanced options, such as closing date and time, minimum and maximum contribution, privacy, brokerage fee if needed.\n\n<strong>Step 4:</strong> Click Create Trade & Confirm creation transaction in MetaMask.\n\n<strong>Step 5:</strong> Contribute to your part of the deal (there are 2 transactions: Approve tokens & Contribute). Choose ‘Fill all’ if you’re planning to be the only participant on your side of the deal, a network fee will apply.\n<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FCHTOT9Z9k'>Video tutorial (this method works for any blockchain)</a>\n\n<strong>Step 6:</strong> Wait for order closing. Please note that your order can be filled by other users or automatically by Rubic if Uniswap’s rate of the pair matches it (including gas fees).\n\n<strong>Important:</strong>\n* Sellers need to have 100% completed their sides of the deal (check video tutorial), so if you plan to be the only seller in your trade you should select ‘Fill all’. This way your part of the deal will be 100% completed, and will make it available for other buyers (or the Limit Orders functionality). \n** If a buyer wants to partially fill your order, the Limit Order feature will still perform its part and will automatically fill the rest of your order until it's 100% completed.\n*** If the expiration date of the trade has been reached, you can get your tokens back by going to your trades table and click on ‘Withdraw’ button (a network fee will apply).\n\nThe first pair of tokens that is available for the Limit Orders is RBC/ETH. We plan to add new pairs and support for multiple blockchains later: Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain.\n\nPlease note that the deal will be closed after the time specified in the “CLOSING DATE” parameter is reached."
